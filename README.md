#### Description:

Hello everyone, my name is Jo√£o, and I'm from Porto, Portugal. This is my final project for CS50x. During the CS50 course, I also completed courses in React and Node.js simultaneously. As a result, I decided to utilize React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.

The landing page provides an overview of the website's features. To get started, users can sign up by providing their name, username, and a password (all required). Once registered, the system automatically logs them in, storing their session securely in the browser's localStorage. The login session will be saved for 60 minutes.

The same happens when the user logs in with an already created account, having access for 60 minutes and then, a re-login is required.

On the landing page before login, you can find an assortment of functionalities, including the ability to create, complete, and delete tasks. These tasks can be easily managed by marking them as completed or removing them with a click of a button. The intuitive design ensures that users can quickly adapt to the interface.

After login, to keep users motivated, a refreshing feature generates inspirational quotes. Your tasks are entirely personalized, so your task list will differ from other users, ensuring a unique experience.

In terms of design, I opted for a clean and straightforward style initially. However, I have plans to revisit the project in the future. I intend to modernize the design and introduce additional features, such as drag-and-drop functionality for task organization, a pop-up for detailed task viewing (including title, description, and due date), a calendar, and a timeline. Implementing a dashboard with statistics is also in the pipeline, but I acknowledge that I need to gain more experience before incorporating these advanced features.

In summary, this website combines the power of React and Node.js to offer a practical and motivating task management solution. It's designed for ease of use, with future plans to enrich the user experience and aesthetics.

For now, it serves as a great tool for keeping track of tasks, but it's only the beginning.
This project has been a fantastic opportunity to learn, and I'm excited to continue growing as a developer.

Thank you CS50x!
